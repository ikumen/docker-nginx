# durian server
I built a little server from a bunch of spare parts, and want to containerize all the services I plan to run. I'm documenting all it along the way for future reference. This documentation will focus on post hardware and OS install, since that part is pretty easy compared to installing, configuring the various services a typical home server might run&mdash;hopefully Docker will simply all of that.

So what do I plan to run on this server? I have a couple projects (Java, Python webapps and a database) and a Minecraft server that I plan to set up with my kids.

### Hardware / Operating System 
There's a lot of great [tutorials on how to build a home server](https://www.google.com/search?q=building+a+server+hardware) so I'll leave it at that. As for the OS, I will be using a Debian based Linux distro. Again, tons of stuff on the [net for installing Linux](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+linux+tutorial) (I can't believe the first link is from forbes.com at the time of this post).

_Here's a little peak at my baby, :-). I didn't have a case, so I jerry-rigged one._
