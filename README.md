# durian server

My home server die recently&mdash;after running for about 4+ years without any issues. The root cause is probably hardware related, as it won't even turn on. It was pretty old&mdash;most of the components were from ~2014&mdash;so I decided to build a new server with more recent spare parts I had lying around. My least favorite part about setting up a server is installing and configuring all of the services that I plan to run. I figured this time around, I'll just run a bare bones Linux distro and containerize all the services, so that my next install would be a simple `git clone` and `docker-compose up`. The other thing I wanted to do this time around was document the process and keep make it publicly available so I can share with others.

### Hardware / Operating System 

I don't plan to document the hardware or OS install, as both of those installs are relatively simple and straight forward. Plus, there's plenty of great tutorials on [building a computer](https://www.google.com/search?q=building+a+server+hardware) and [how to install Linux](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+linux+tutorial) (I can't believe the first link is from forbes.com at the time of this post) out on the net.

_Here's a peak at the little guy :-). I didn't have a case, so I jerry-rigged one._
